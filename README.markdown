Dotfiles
========
Here are my dotfiles. Clone them in `~/dotfiles/`.
Run `~/dotfiles/install.sh`. This will move previous config files 
to `~/dotfiles_old/` and will symlink to config files in 
`~/dotfiles/`. It will also install zsh, clone oh-my-zsh
(for configurations) and make it the default terminal.

Installation
------------

``` bash
git clone git://github.com/albertzaharovits/dotfiles ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```
